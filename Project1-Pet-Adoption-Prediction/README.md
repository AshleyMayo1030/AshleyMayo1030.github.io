# Pet Adoption Prediction 
This project aims to help animal shelters uncover the hidden patterns that lead to different outcomes (i.e., adoption, euthenasia, transfer, etc.). By identifying patterns early, shelters can act with foresight instead of hindsight, and help more animals find a second chance at life.
