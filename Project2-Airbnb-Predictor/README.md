# Airbnb Price Predictor

This project addresses a real-world problem for Airbnb hosts and property managers who often struggle to set optimal prices for their listings. Overpricing can lead to lower booking rates, while underpricing reduces revenue potential. By predicting listing prices based on actual market data, this project will help hosts make data-driven decisions to stay competitive.
